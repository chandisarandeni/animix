      <h2>Morning in the Forest</h2>
      <pre>
        The forest wakes with a golden hush. Dew sparkles on leaves, and light
        slips gently through the trees. Every sound is soft—a bird’s call, the
        rustle of wind—like nature’s quiet greeting to the day.

      <h2>Whispers of the Trees</h2>
      <pre>
        Tall and ancient, the trees stand like silent storytellers.
        Their leaves murmur with secrets as the breeze moves through them.
        Each rustle carries the voice of time,
        speaking softly to those who listen.

      <h2>The Forest Path</h2>
      <pre>
        A narrow trail curls through the woods like a hidden thought. Moss
        covers stones, and roots twist underfoot. It invites the curious, the
        quiet, the dreamers to wander where few have stepped.
